# FUEL MSC DESIGN SYSTEM

The **FUEL MSC DESIGN SYSTEM** is a design system created with the aim of centralizing and documenting MSC's web components. This system allows users and developers to interact efficiently with the components, facilitating their understanding and use.

## Objective

Our goal is to provide a scalable and efficient method to keep the user interface updated and of high quality. We believe that good design and good documentation are key to achieving an excellent user experience.

## Components

The components of the design system are documented in detail, including examples of use, available properties, and events. This allows developers to quickly understand how to use each component and what functionalities it offers.

## Interaction

Users and developers can interact with the components directly in the documentation, allowing them to experience firsthand the behavior and functionalities of each component.

## Maintenance

The design system is maintained and updated regularly to ensure that the components follow the latest design trends and meet accessibility standards.
